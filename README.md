# react side scroller 

React Side Scroller is a personal project of what I can do with react as a side-scroller engine. This is just a fun project where I expect to make a ton of mistakes and produce nothing of value other than learning what I can and can't do.

## Development

Start by running `npm install` and `npm run dev`

Note that there are a ton of node modules that are installed. This is direct consequence of copy and pasting from another project of mine and not doing any clean up what-so-ever. :smile:
